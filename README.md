I am a Research Software Engineer in the department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.
I develop the Ratel and libCEED libraries as part of CU Boulder's PSAAP center.
After graduating from the US Air Force Academy, I served as an advanced weapon systems analyst, testing the accuracy and reliability of aircraft based nuclear weapons.
I previously served on the faculty at the US Air Force Academy.
I completed my PhD in applied mathematics from the CU Boulder in 2021.
My research interests include preconditioning for high order finite element-like operators and sustainable open source scientific software development.
I am also a mentor and community leader online at freeCodeCamp, a free and open source resource for learning programming and web development.
